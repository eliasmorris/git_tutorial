To die when the sad light retires 
its golden network from the green waves 
to be like the sun that slowly expires; 
something very luminous that fades. 

To die, and die young, before 
fleeting time removes the gentle crown, 
while life still says: "I'm yours" 
though we know with our hearts that she lies.
